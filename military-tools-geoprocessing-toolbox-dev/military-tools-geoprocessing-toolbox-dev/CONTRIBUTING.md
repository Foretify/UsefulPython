Esri welcomes contributions from anyone and everyone. Please see our [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/esri/contributing).

### Testing the tools
In this case testing is to take the tools from the repository and report success and failure (log issues) without modifying the tools, or modifying the source code.

1. Click the **Download Zip** button.
2. Extract the ZIP tools to a working folder
3. Use the included [testdata] to manually test each tool
4. Log [issues](https://github.com/Esri/military-tools-geoprocessing-toolbox/issues) for any problems found (if they haven't been logged already)

### Building the tools
Building the tools means modifying existing tools or adding new tools. In this case you should be familiar with GitHub and creating geoprocessing tools.

1. Create a new branch from "dev" branch:
	* Include your initials in the branch name, eg. *"mf-new-tool"*
2. Clone it to your local machine
3. Make your changes locally
4. Commit your changes and Sync with your remote
5. Create a Pull Request to have your updates merged to "dev"
